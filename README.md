## Experience

Full-time senior developer and group leader at my parent's coutch (2021 -
now). Used to program while watching TV and / or talking with people so I feel
like a strong programmer as I never missed a single semicolon.

## Personal aspiration

I want to base my daily workflow in tools written by myself
