## Experience

Full-time senior developer and group leader at my parent's coutch (2021 -
now). Used to program while watching TV and / or talking with people so I feel
like a strong programmer as I never missed a single semicolon.

## Motivation

I program because I enjoy it, since if money or fame were my motivation, I would have quit a long time ago.
